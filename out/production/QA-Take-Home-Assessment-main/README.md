## What the application does

This simple web application. This application calculates the factorial of a number.
The factorial of a number is the product of all the integers from 1 to that number. For example, the factorial of 6 is 1*2*3*4*5*6 = 720 . Factorial is not defined for negative numbers, and the factorial of zero is one, 0!

We have exactly one page with:

* one text box 
* one submit button
* a page title 
* three hyperlinks 
* a copyright message

## Setup

1. `pip install requirements.txt`
2. To start the application, run `python qa_interview.py` 
3. Visit `localhost:6464` in your browser.

## QA Requirements for you to implement

1. Write a locator (CSS selector/XPath) for the red form validation styling
2. Find the console message printed
3. Write a Selenium script to test that the factorial of 7 is 5040
4. Figure out the API call being made along with the headers and parameters sent
5. Write a bug report
6. Document a test case
7. Include test coverage
8. Add any documentation that might be necessary to explain your process, include this in a file in the repo.
